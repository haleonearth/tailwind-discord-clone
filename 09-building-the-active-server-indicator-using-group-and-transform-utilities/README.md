# Building the Active Server Indicator using Group and Transform Utilities

Let's build the active server indicator (the final piece of our server buttons) using an absolutely positioned div alongside Tailwind's position utilities. We'll then learn how to use Groups to affect the styling of the indicator when hovering over the ancestor link. Finally, we'll use the scale and translate utilities to add the final bit of polish and match Discord's UI.
